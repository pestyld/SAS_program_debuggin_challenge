# SAS Programming Debugging Challenge

## Scenario
You are an analyst at the National Hurricane Center. Your department has been working on a project 
to create a program that will enable the department to increase efficiency when analyzing and 
reporting storms. 

Currently, this process is done manually, but a previous analyst attempted to streamline the process 
using SAS. The analyst was close to finishing but has been pulled off the project. 
With your SAS experience, your manager has tasked you with debugging the SAS program that the 
previous analyst wrote. However, this program contains logic and syntax errors. Lucky for you, the 
previous analyst has documented many of the issues.
